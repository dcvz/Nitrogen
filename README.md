# Nitrogen [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dcvz/Nitrogen.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/dcvz/Nitrogen)
Nintendo DS emulator for iOS

## Status
Currently you can launch a game by modifying `"game.nds"` in `EmulatorViewController`. iTunes transfer is already enabled so you may transfer a ROM through there. Future updates will add proper game handling and selection methods :)
