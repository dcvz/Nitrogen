# Nitrogen [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dcvz/Nitrogen.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/dcvz/Nitrogen)
Nitrogen is a modern Nintendo DS Emulator for iOS based of DeSmuME. 

## Adding ROMs
Currently the only way to get ROMs into your device is through iTunes. Open iTunes, select your Device, go to the apps section, find Nitrogen and drag the ROMs into the root file system. The games will appear in your library promptly after.

## Reporting Bugs
If you find a bug please open a GitHub issue ticket [here](https://github.com/dcvz/Nitrogen/issues/new). Please try to include as much information as you can about the issue and your device; but please don't create issues for:
- slow performance (we're constantly working on it)
- crashing on older devices (anything older than an iPhone 5)
